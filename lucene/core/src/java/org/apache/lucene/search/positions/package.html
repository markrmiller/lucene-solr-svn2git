<BODY>
The positions package provides mechanisms to enable querying using minimum interval semantics, as defined in
<a href="http://vigna.dsi.unimi.it/ftp/papers/EfficientAlgorithmsMinimalIntervalSemantics">"Efficient Optimally Lazy Algorithms for Minimal-Interval Semantics</a>
<p>
  The following Query implementations are provided:
  <ol>
    <li>{@link org.apache.lucene.search.positions.IntervalFilterQuery - IntervalFilterQuery} -- Filter a Query based on the positions or ranges of its component parts</li>
    <li>{@link org.apache.lucene.search.positions.OrderedNearQuery - OrderedNearQuery} -- Filter queries based on the ordered difference between their match positions in a document</li>
    <li>{@link org.apache.lucene.search.positions.UnorderedNearQuery - UnorderedNearQuery} -- Filter queries based on the unordered difference between their match positions in a document</li>
    <li>{@link org.apache.lucene.search.positions.NonOverlappingQuery - NonOverlappingQuery} -- Match queries whose match positions do not overlap</li>
  </ol>
  All queries require positions to be stored in the index.
