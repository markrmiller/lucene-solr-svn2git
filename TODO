nocommit this!

TODO
  - associations
  - wrap an IW instead of extending one?
  - re-enable ALL_BUT_DIM somehow?
  - simplify ddq api
  - SSDVValueSourceFacets?
  - we could put more stuff into the "schema", e.g. this field is
    sorted-set-DV and that one is taxo?
  - standardize on facet or facets (e.g. FacetIndexWriter)
  - fewer args when constructing a range
  - rename CategoryPath -> FacetLabel
  - how to do avg() agg?
  - test needsScores=true / valuesource associations
  - make FieldTypes optional (if all your dims are flat)?
  - add hierarchy to ssdv facets?
  - sparse faceting: allow skipping of certain dims?
  - maybe an interface/abstract class for "FacetResults"?  has common
    API, ie to get top facets under a path, get all dims; then DS can
    use this?
  - consistently name things "dimension"? calling these fields is CONFUSING
