/** IndexReader is an abstract class, providing an interface for accessing an
 index.  Search of an index is done entirely through this abstract interface,
 so that any subclass which implements it is searchable.

 <p> Concrete subclasses of IndexReader are usually constructed with a call to
 one of the static <code>open()</code> methods, e.g. {@link
 #open(Directory)}.

 <p> For efficiency, in this API documents are often referred to via
 <i>document numbers</i>, non-negative integers which each name a unique
 document in the index.  These document numbers are ephemeral--they may change
 as documents are added to and deleted from an index.  Clients should thus not
 rely on a given document having the same number between sessions.

 <p>
 <b>NOTE</b>: for backwards API compatibility, several methods are not listed 
 as abstract, but have no useful implementations in this base class and 
 instead always throw UnsupportedOperationException.  Subclasses are 
 strongly encouraged to override these methods, but in many cases may not 
 need to.
 </p>

 <p>

 <a name="thread-safety"></a><p><b>NOTE</b>: {@link
 IndexReader} instances are completely thread
 safe, meaning multiple threads can call any of its methods,
 concurrently.  If your application requires external
 synchronization, you should <b>not</b> synchronize on the
 <code>IndexReader</code> instance; use your own
 (non-Lucene) objects instead.
