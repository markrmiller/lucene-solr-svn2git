TODO
  - associations
  - cutover taxo writer/reader to pathToString/stringToPath
  - wrap an IW instead of extending one?  or, FacetDocument?
  - re-enable ALL_BUT_DIM somehow?
  - we could put more stuff into the "schema", e.g. this field is
    sorted-set-DV and that one is taxo?
  - standardize on facet or facets (e.g. FacetIndexWriter)
  - fewer args when constructing a range
  - how to do avg() agg?
  - test needsScores=true / valuesource associations
  - make FieldTypes optional (if all your dims are flat)?
  - consistently name things "dimension"? calling these fields is CONFUSING
  - later
    - SSDVValueSourceFacets?
    - add hierarchy to ssdv facets?
    - sparse faceting: allow skipping of certain dims?
