# Apache Lucene Migration Guide

## Removed Reader from Tokenizer constructor (LUCENE-5388)

The constructor of Tokenizer no longer takes Reader, as this was a leftover
from before it was reusable. See the org.apache.lucene.analysis package
documentation for more details.

## Refactored Collector API (LUCENE-5299)

The Collector API has been refactored to use a different Collector instance
per segment. It is possible to migrate existing collectors painlessly by
extending SimpleCollector instead of Collector: SimpleCollector is a
specialization of Collector that returns itself as a per-segment Collector.
